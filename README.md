# LPG Gas sensor leakage Detection

The MQ-2 sensor can detect multiple gases (CO, H2, CH4, LPG, propane, alcohol, smoke) and outputs analog voltage. This project can convert it to digital using ADS1015 or ADS1115 and filter out the target gases.

The sensor can be inaccurate so don't use those measurements if you need them for security purposes. Use some professional measurement device if you need to do this.
